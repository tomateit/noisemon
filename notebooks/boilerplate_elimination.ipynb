We market our products through our internal sales force, independent sales representatives and distributors primarily to Original Equipment Manufacturers (\"OEMs\") and retailers located around the world. Our success is largely dependent on the market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor products, efficient utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure, successful ongoing development of advanced product and process technologies and generating a return on R&D investments.\n",

We generally reduce the manufacturing cost of each generation of product through advancements in product and process technologies, such as our leading-edge line-width process technology. We continue to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, such as higher data transfer rates, reduced package size, lower power consumption, improved read/ write reliability and increased memory density. To leverage our significant investments in R&D, we have formed, and may continue to form, strategic joint ventures that allow us to share the costs of developing memory product and process technologies with joint venture partners. In addition, from time to time, we also sell and/or license technology to other parties.

      "On July 31, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Elpida, now known as MMJ, and a controlling interest in Rexchip, now known as MMT (together, the \"MMJ Acquisition\"). The MMJ Acquisition included a 300mm DRAM wafer fabrication facility located in Hiroshima, Japan, a 300mm DRAM wafer fabrication facility in Taichung City, Taiwan and an assembly and test facility located in Akita, Japan. These wafer fabrication facilities together represented approximately 30% of our total wafer capacity for 2014. The operations from the MMJ Acquisition, which are included primarily in our MBU and CNBU segments, include the manufacture of Mobile DRAM targeted to mobile phones and tablets and computing DRAM targeted to desktop PCs, servers, notebooks and workstations. In connection with the MMJ Acquisition, we recorded net assets of $2.60 billion, noncontrolling interests of $168 million and a gain on the transaction of $1.48 billion in 2013.

As a result of this oversight and related consent rights of the Japan Court and the legal trustee, our ability to effectively integrate the MMJ Companies as part of our global operations or to cause the MMJ Companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the Japan Court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions.

Nearly all of our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment. A significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment.

      "Our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex, involving a number of precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly and test. Efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities. The primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process line-width, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer. Other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size, cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment. We continuously enhance our production processes, reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products. In 2014, the majority of our DRAM production was manufactured on our 30nm line-width process technology. We expect that in 2015 that the majority of our DRAM production will be manufactured on our 25nm and 20nm line-width process technologies. In 2014, a majority of our NAND Flash memory production was manufactured on 20nm line-width process technology. We expect that in 2015 a majority of our NAND Flash production will be manufactured on our 16nm line-width process technology.

Shortages may occur from time to time in the future. We and/or our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials.

Our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs. Transitions to smaller line-width process technologies and product and process improvements have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production. Our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\n",

The plans of reorganization of the MMJ Companies prohibit the MMJ Companies from paying dividends, including any cash dividends, to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the MMJ Companies' installment payments.

For certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier. From time to time we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the supplier's limited capacity. Our inability to timely obtain this equipment could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs. Delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp.

We have filed three petitions for inter-partes review by the Patent and Trademark Office, challenging the validity of each of the patents in suit. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\"PTAB\") held a hearing in connection with the three petitions on December 9, 2013. On March 10, 2014, the PTAB issued written decisions finding that each and every claim in the three patents in suit is invalid, and cancelled all claims. The University has appealed the PTAB rulings to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n",

      "On December 7, 2007, Tessera, Inc. filed a patent infringement action against MMJ, Elpida Memory (USA) Inc., and numerous other defendants, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges that certain MMJ and Elpida Memory (USA) Inc. products infringe four U.S. patents and seeks injunctive relief, damages, attorneys' fees, and costs. Prior to answering the complaint, MMJ and Elpida Memory (USA) Inc. and other defendants filed motions to stay the case pending final resolution of a case before the International Trade Commission (\"ITC\") against MMJ and Elpida Memory (USA) Inc. and other respondents, alleging infringement of the same patents asserted in the Eastern District of Texas case (In The Matter of Certain Semiconductor Chips with Minimized Chip Package Size and Products Containing Same (III), ITC No. 337-TA-630 (the \"ITC Action\")). On February 25, 2008, the Eastern District of Texas Court granted the defendants' motion to stay the action. On December 29, 2009, the ITC issued a Notice of Final Determination in the ITC Action finding no violation by MMJ and Elpida Memory (USA) Inc. Tessera, Inc. subsequently appealed the matter to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On May 23, 2011, the Federal Circuit affirmed the ITC's Final Determination. Additionally, by operation of the Recognition Order, plaintiff in that action is permanently enjoined from continuing its case against MMJ and Elpida Memory (USA) in respect of any claim or claims arising prior to the commencement of the Japan Proceeding (as defined in the Recognition Order). On July 30, 2014, we entered into a five-year term patent cross-license agreement with Tessera, which also settled the pending litigation against MMJ and Elpida Memory (USA). The agreement, which requires us to make quarterly payments over its term, gives us \"life-of-product\" protection for specifically identified DRAM products and a term license for certain other products.\n",

      "A number of purported class action price-fixing lawsuits have been filed against us and other DRAM suppliers. Four cases have been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California asserting claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities that indirectly purchased DRAM and/or products containing DRAM from various DRAM suppliers during the time period from April 1, 1999 through at least June 30, 2002. The complaints allege a conspiracy to increase DRAM prices in violation of federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair competition law, and/or unjust enrichment relating to the sale and pricing of DRAM products. The complaints seek joint and several damages, trebled, monetary damages, restitution, costs, interest and attorneys' fees. In addition, at least sixty-four cases have been filed in various state courts asserting claims on behalf of a purported class of indirect purchasers of DRAM. In July 2006, the Attorneys General for approximately forty U.S. states and territories filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaints allege, among other things, violations of the Sherman Act, Cartwright Act, and certain other states' consumer protection and antitrust laws and seek joint and several damages, trebled, as well as injunctive and other relief. On October 3, 2008, the California Attorney General filed a similar lawsuit in California Superior Court, purportedly on behalf of local California government entities, alleging, among other things, violations of the Cartwright Act and state unfair competition law. On June 23, 2010, we executed a settlement agreement resolving these purported class-action indirect purchaser cases and the pending cases of the Attorneys General relating to alleged DRAM price-fixing in the United States. Subject to certain conditions, we agreed to pay approximately $67 million in aggregate in three equal installments over a two-year period. We paid the full amount into an escrow account by the end of the first quarter of 2013 in accordance with the settlement agreement.\n",

The complaint seeks to void under Section 133 of the German Insolvency Act a share purchase agreement between Micron B.V. and Qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which Micron B.V. purchased substantially all of Qimonda's shares of Inotera Memories, Inc. (the \"Inotera Shares\"), representing approximately 55% of our total shares in Inotera, and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer those shares to the Qimonda estate. The complaint also seeks, among other things, to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with Inotera and to terminate under Sections 103 or 133 of the German Insolvency Code a patent cross-license between us and Qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement.\n",

In addition, the Court issued interlocutory judgments ordering, among other things: (1) that Micron B.V. transfer to the Qimonda estate the Inotera Shares still owned by it and pay to the Qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any Inotera Shares sold to third parties; and (2) that Micron B.V. pay the Qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by it from ownership of the Inotera Shares. The interlocutory judgments have no immediate, enforceable effect on us, and, accordingly, we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the Inotera Shares subject to further developments in the case. We have filed a notice of appeal, and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals court. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for February 2, 2015.\n",

We have owned 51% of IMFT from inception through August 28, 2014 . Our ownership percentage of IMFS had increased from 51% at inception to 82% as of April 6, 2012 due to a series of contributions by us that were not fully matched by Intel. On April 6, 2012 , we entered into a series of agreements with Intel to restructure IM Flash, in which we acquired Intel's remaining 18% interest in IMFS for $466 million . In addition, we acquired IMFT's assets located at our Virginia wafer fabrication facility, for which Intel received a distribution from IMFT of $139 million . For both transactions, the amounts Intel received approximated the book values of Intel's interests in the assets acquired. We consolidate IM Flash and report Intel's ownership interests as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. (See \"Item 8.

Through December 2012, we purchased 50% of Inotera's wafer production capacity based on a margin-sharing formula among Nanya, Inotera and us. Since January 2013, we have purchased substantially all of Inotera's DRAM output at a discount from market prices for our comparable components under a new supply agreement (the \"Inotera Supply Agreement\"). Our costs for supply from Inotera increased in 2014 from 2013 due to changes in average selling prices for our DRAM products and the changes in the pricing terms. The Inotera Supply Agreement has a three-year term (currently through December 2016) that contemplates annual negotiations with respect to potential successive one-year extensions. If the parties do not agree to an extension, the agreement will terminate following the end of the then-existing term plus a subsequent three-year wind-down period. In the event of a wind-down, our share of Inotera's capacity would decline over the wind-down period. In 2014, our cost of products purchased from Inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our wholly-owned facilities. We are currently in negotiations regarding the extension of the Inotera Supply Agreement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement. As of August 28, 2014 , our ownership interest in Inotera was 33% . (See \"Item 8.

      "Through December 2012, we purchased 50% of Inotera's wafer production capacity based on a margin-sharing formula among Nanya, Inotera and us. Since January 2013, we have purchased substantially all of Inotera's DRAM output at a discount from market prices for our comparable components under a new supply agreement (the \"Inotera Supply Agreement\"). Our costs for supply from Inotera increased in 2014 from 2013 due to increases in average selling prices for our DRAM products and the changes in the pricing terms. The Inotera Supply Agreement has a three-year term (currently through December 2016) that contemplates annual negotiations with respect to potential successive one-year extensions. If the parties do not agree to an extension, the agreement will terminate following the end of the then-existing term plus a subsequent three-year wind-down period. In the event of a wind-down, our share of Inotera's capacity would decline over the wind-down period. In 2014, our cost of products purchased from Inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our wholly-owned facilities. We are currently in negotiations regarding the extension of the Inotera Supply Agreement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement. Under the Inotera supply agreements, we purchased $2.68 billion , $1.26 billion , and $646 million of DRAM products in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\n",

For 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013, our costs of goods sold for DRAM products included the sale of the MMJ Group's inventories recorded at fair value in the MMJ Acquisition, which was higher than the manufacturing cost of such inventories.

The remaining tax provision for 2014 primarily reflects taxes on our other non-U.S. operations. The provision (benefit) for taxes on U.S. operations for 2014 was substantially offset by changes in the valuation allowance.

Our valuation allowance decreased $712 million for 2014 primarily due to the utilization of U.S. and foreign net operating losses and due to the $190 million benefit to deferred tax assets of the MMJ Group. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if significant positive evidence increases. Management continues to evaluate future financial performance to determine whether such performance is sufficient evidence to support reversal of the valuation allowances.

In addition, pursuant to an order of the Japan Court, the MMJ Companies cannot make loans or advances, other than certain ordinary course advances, to us without the consent of the Japan Court. Moreover, loans or advances by subsidiaries of the MMJ Companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustee and Japan Court.

      "Income Taxes : We are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world. These estimates involve judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex. Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year. We are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income. In recent periods, our results of operations have benefitted from increases in the amount of deferred taxes we expect to realize, primarily from the levels of capital spending and increases in the amount of taxable income we expect to realize in Japan and Taiwan. Our income tax provision or benefit is dependent, in part, on our ability to forecast future taxable income in these and other jurisdictions. Such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve numerous judgments including, among others, projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes, manufacturing and overhead costs, levels of capital spending and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.\n",

      "Inventories : Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value. Cost includes labor, material and overhead costs, including product and process technology costs. Determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments, including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories. To project average selling prices and sales volumes, we review recent sales volumes, existing customer orders, current contract prices, industry analyses of supply and demand, seasonal factors, general economic trends and other information. When these analyses reflect estimated market values below our manufacturing costs, we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold. Differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of write-down recorded. For example, a 5% variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated market value of our memory inventory by approximately $254 million as of August 28, 2014. Due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry, actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and, as a result, the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly.\n",

In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. The estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by us, including, but not limited to, future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets, future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes.

We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n",

      "To hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities, we utilize a rolling hedge strategy with currency forward contracts that generally mature within 35 days. Based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities, offset by balance sheet hedges, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would result in losses of approximately $7 million as of August 28, 2014 and $19 million as of August 29, 2013 . To hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures and forecasted operating cash flows, we utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within 12 months and currency options that generally mature within 12 to 18 months.\n",

      "As of August 28, 2018, under the terms and conditions of the MMJ Companies' plans of reorganization, we are obligated to pay 142 billion yen (or the equivalent of $1.37 billion based on exchange rates as of August 28, 2014) to the external creditors of the MMJ Companies. The installment payments are due at the end of each calendar year beginning in 2014 through 2019. To mitigate the risk that increases in exchange rates have on the payments due in 2014 and 2015, we entered into forward contracts to purchase 20 billion yen on November 28, 2014 and 10 billion yen on November 27, 2015. In addition, the MMJ Companies' cash and equivalent balances in yen mitigate the foreign currency exchange risk associated with the remaining installment payments due in 2015 and after.

Through our worldwide operations, we manufacture and market a full range of DRAM, NAND Flash and NOR Flash memory, as well as other innovative memory technologies, packaging solutions and semiconductor systems for use in leading-edge computing, consumer, networking, automotive, industrial, embedded and mobile products.

      "Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may differ under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ from estimates.\n",

Under our general terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. Under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our general terms and conditions. Our warranty obligations are not significant.\n",

If we are unable to reasonably estimate returns or the price is not fixed or determinable, sales made under agreements allowing rights of return or price protection are deferred until customers have resold the product.\n",

      "Research and Development: Costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as research and development as incurred. Determining when product development is complete requires judgment. Development of a product is deemed complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and has passed tests for performance and reliability. Subsequent to product qualification, product costs are valued in inventory. Product design and other research and development costs for certain technologies are shared with our joint venture partners. Amounts receivable from cost-sharing arrangements are reflected as a reduction of research and development expense.

      "Derivative and Hedging Instruments: We use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities or future cash flows and to reduce the volatility that changes in interest rates on variable-rate debt have on our earnings. Our currency derivatives have consisted of forward and option contracts and interest rate swap contracts. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative instruments are measured at their fair values and recognized as either assets or liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments is based on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges for accounting purpose, gains or losses from changes in fair values are recognized in other non-operating income (expense). For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss is included as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), and the ineffective or excluded portion of the gain or loss is included in other non-operating income (expense). The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for these cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same line items of the consolidated statements of operation and in the same periods in which the underlying transactions affect earnings. Effectiveness is measured by comparing the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item. For the effectiveness assessment of our cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded for forward contracts.\n",

Cost includes depreciation, labor, material and overhead costs, including product and process technology costs. Determining market values of inventories involves numerous judgments, including projecting future average selling prices, sales volumes and costs to complete products in work in process inventories. When market values are below costs, we record a charge to cost of goods sold to write down inventories to their estimated market value in advance of when the inventories are actually sold. Inventories are primarily categorized as memory (including DRAM, NAND Flash and NOR Flash) for purposes of determining lower of average cost or market.

This ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. This ASU will be effective for us in our first quarter of 2018. Early adoption is not permitted. The ASU allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption.

Since January 2013, we have purchased substantially all of Inotera's DRAM output at a discount from market prices for our comparable components under a new supply agreement (the \"Inotera Supply Agreement\"). Our costs for supply from Inotera increased in 2014 from 2013 due to changes in average selling prices for our DRAM products and the changes in the pricing terms. The Inotera Supply Agreement has a three-year term (currently through December 2016) that contemplates annual negotiations with respect to potential successive one-year extensions. If the parties do not agree to an extension, the agreement will terminate following the end of the then-existing term plus a subsequent three-year wind-down period. In the event of a wind-down, our share of Inotera's capacity would decline over the wind-down period. In 2014, our cost of products purchased from Inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our wholly-owned facilities. We are currently in negotiations regarding the extension of the Inotera Supply Agreement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement.

Rambus' complaint alleged various causes of action under California state law including, among other things, a conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices, a conspiracy to monopolize, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and unfair competition. Rambus sought a judgment for damages of approximately $3.90 billion, joint and several liability, trebling of damages awarded, punitive damages, a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint, interest, and attorneys' fees and costs. Trial began on June 20, 2011, and the case went to the jury on September 21, 2011. On November 16, 2011, the jury found for us on all claims.

Prior to answering the complaint, MMJ and Elpida Memory (USA) Inc. and other defendants filed motions to stay the case pending final resolution of a case before the International Trade Commission (\"ITC\") against MMJ and Elpida Memory (USA) Inc. and other respondents, alleging infringement of the same patents asserted in the Eastern District of Texas case (In The Matter of Certain Semiconductor Chips with Minimized Chip Package Size and Products Containing Same (III), ITC No. 337-TA-630 (the \"ITC Action\")). On February 25, 2008, the Eastern District of Texas Court granted the defendants' motion to stay the action.

The complaints seek joint and several damages, trebled, in addition to restitution, costs and attorneys' fees. A number of these cases were removed to federal court and transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California for consolidated pre-trial proceedings. In July 2006, the Attorneys General for approximately forty U.S. states and territories filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

On October 3, 2008, the California Attorney General filed a similar lawsuit in California Superior Court, purportedly on behalf of local California government entities, alleging, among other things, violations of the Cartwright Act and state unfair competition law.

In addition, the Court issued interlocutory judgments ordering, among other things: (1) that Micron B.V. transfer to the Qimonda estate the Inotera Shares still owned by it and pay to the Qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any Inotera Shares sold to third parties; and (2) that Micron B.V. pay the Qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by it from ownership of the Inotera Shares. The interlocutory judgments have no immediate, enforceable effect on us, and, accordingly, we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the Inotera Shares subject to further developments in the case.

We invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and, by policy, generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments with any single obligor. A concentration of credit risk may exist with respect to receivables as a substantial portion of our customers are affiliated with the computing industry. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers worldwide and generally do not require collateral from our customers. Historically, we have not experienced significant losses on receivables. A concentration of risk may also exist with respect to derivatives as the number of counterparties to our currency hedges is limited and the notional amounts are relatively large. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and through entering into master netting arrangements. The capped calls expose us to credit risk to the extent the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading the risk across several major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.\n",

In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item 8 present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 28, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n",

Substantially all of this amount relates to guarantees for debt of wholly-owned entities whereby Micron would be obligated to perform under the guarantee if a subsidiary were to default on the terms of their debt arrangements. In the event of performance under the guarantee, Micron would be permitted to seek reimbursement from the subsidiary company(s) through liquidation of the assets collateralized by the various debt instruments. At the time these contracts were entered into, the collateralized assets approximated the value of the outstanding guarantees. The majority of these guarantees expire at various times between December 2014 and January 2019 . Micron also guarantees credit facilities of certain of its subsidiaries that provide for up to $408 million of financing.

Micron is currently a party to various litigation regarding patent, antitrust, commercial and other matters. Micron is a party to the matters listed in the \"Contingencies\" note in the consolidated financial statements, with the exception of the complaint filed on July 12, 2013 by seven former shareholders of Elpida (now known as MMJ) against the board of directors of MMJ as of February 2013 and the patent infringement case Tessera Inc., which was resolved on July 30, 2014.

The gain approximated Micron's share of the consideration because the carrying value of its investment had been reduced to zero since the second quarter of 2012, at which time Micron ceased recognizing its proportionate share of Aptina's losses.
